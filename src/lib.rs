//! Interprocess communication toolkit for Rust programs. The crate aims to
//! expose as many platform-specific features as possible while maintaining a
//! uniform interface for all platforms.
//!
//! # Features
//! - Cross-platform interprocess communication primitives:
//!     - **Unnamed pipes** — anonymous file-like objects for communicating
//!       privately in one direction, most commonly used to communicate between
//!       a child process and its parent
//!     - **Local sockets** — similar to TCP sockets, but use filesystem or
//!       namespaced paths instead of ports on `localhost`, depending on the OS,
//!       bypassing the network stack entirely; implemented using named pipes on
//!       Windows and Unix domain sockets on Unix
//! - POSIX-specific interprocess communication primitives:
//!     - **FIFO files** — special type of file which is similar to unnamed
//!       pipes but exists on the filesystem, often referred to as "named pipes"
//!       but completely different from Windows named pipes
//!     - **Unix domain sockets** — a type of socket which is built around the
//!       standard networking APIs but uses filesystem paths instead of ports on
//!       `localhost`, optionally using a spearate namespace on Linux akin to
//!       Windows named pipes
//!     - **POSIX signals** — used to receive short urgent messages from the OS
//!       and other programs, as well as sending those messages *(practical
//!       usage, other than for compatibility reasons, is strongly discouraged)*
//! - Windows-specific interprocess communication primitives:
//!     - **Named pipes** — closely resembles Unix domain sockets, uses a
//!       separate namespace instead of on-drive paths
//!     - **C signals** — like POSIX signals, but with less signal types and a
//!       smaller API *(practical usage, other than for compatibility reasons,
//!       is strongly discouraged)*
//! - **Async support** — efficient wrapper around local sockets, Windows named
//!   pipes and Ud-sockets for high-performance parallelism, currently only
//!   supports the Tokio runtime
//!

// TODO mailslots
// TODO shared memory
// - **Mailslots** — Windows-specific interprocess communication primitive for short messages,
//   potentially even across the network
// - **Shared memory** — exposes a nice safe interface for shared memory based on mapping
//   identifiers, with some additional platform-specific extensions

/// Reading from named pipes with message boundaries reliably, without
/// truncation.
///
/// ## The problem
/// Unlike a byte stream interface, message-mode named pipes preserve boundaries
/// between different write calls, which is what "message boundary" essentially
/// means. Extracting messages by partial reads is an error-prone task, which is
/// why no such interface is exposed by the operating system — instead, all
/// messages read from a named pipe stream are full messages rather than chunks
/// of messages, which simplifies things to a great degree and is arguably the
/// only proper way of implementing datagram support.
///
/// There is one pecularity related to this design: you can't just use a buffer
/// with arbitrary length to successfully read a message. With byte streams,
/// that always works — there either is some data which can be written into that
/// buffer or end of file has been reached, aside from the implied error case
/// which is always a possibility for any kind of I/O. With message streams,
/// however, **there might not always be enough space in a buffer to fetch a
/// whole message**. If the buffer is too small to fetch a message, it won't be
/// written into the buffer, but simply will be ***discarded*** instead. The
/// only way to protect from it being discarded is first checking whether the
/// message fits into the buffer without discarding it and then actually reading
/// it into a suitably large buffer. In such a case, the message needs an
/// alternate channel besides the buffer to somehow get returned.
///
/// This brings the discussion specifically to the signature of the `read_msg`
/// method: ```no_run
/// # use std::io;
/// # trait Tr {
/// fn read_msg(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> io::Result<Result<usize, Vec<u8>>>;
/// # }
/// ```
/// Setting aside from the `io::Result` part, the "true return value" is
/// `Result<usize, Vec<u8>>`. The `Ok(...)` variant here means that the message
/// has been successfully read into the buffer and contains the actual size of
/// the message which has been read. The `Err(...)` variant means that the
/// buffer was too small for the message, containing a freshly allocated buffer
/// which is just big enough to fit the message. The usage strategy is to store
/// a buffer, mutably borrow it and pass it to the `read_msg` function, see if
/// it fits inside the buffer, and if it does not, replace the stored buffer
/// with the new one.
///
/// The `try_read_msg` method is a convenience function used mainly by
/// implementations of `read_msg` to determine whether it's required to allocate
/// a new buffer or not. It has the following signature: ```no_run
/// # use std::io;
/// # trait Tr {
/// fn try_read_msg(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> io::Result<Result<usize, usize>>;
/// # }
/// ```
/// While it may seem strange how the nested `Result` returns the same type in
/// `Ok` and `Err`, it does this for a semantic reason: the `Ok` variant means
/// that the message was successfully read into the buffer while `Err` means the
/// opposite — that the message was too big — and returns the size which the
/// buffer needs to have.
///
/// ## Platform support
/// The trait is implemented for:
/// - Named pipes on Windows (module `interprocess::os::windows::named_pipe`)
/// - Unix domain pipes, but only on Linux (module
///   `interprocess::os::unix::udsocket`)
///     - This is because only Linux provides a special flag for `recv` which
///       returns the amount of bytes in the message regardless of the provided
///       buffer size when peeking.
