//! Platform-specific functionality for various interprocess communication
//! primitives.
//!
//! This module houses two modules: [`unix`] and [`windows`]. Depending on your
//! platform, one of those is available, so if you only see one module here,
//! don't worry â€” it's just not available for the platform on which you're
//! browsing the docs. If you're using [Docs.rs], you can see the documentation
//! for other platforms using the navigation bar on the top of the page.
