//! Support for named pipes on Windows.
//!
//! ## Windows named pipes are not Unix named pipes
//! The term "named pipe" refers to completely different things in Unix and
//! Windows. For this reason, Unix named pipes are referred to as "FIFO files"
//! to avoid confusion with the more powerful Windows named pipes. In fact, the
//! only common features for those two is that they both can be located using
//! filesystem paths and they both use a stream interface. The differences can
//! be summed up like this:
//! - Windows named pipes are located on a separate filesystem (NPFS â€” **N**amed
//!   **P**ipe **F**ile**s**ystem), while Unix FIFO files live in the shared
//!   filesystem tree together with all other files
//!     - On Linux, the implementation of Unix domain sockets exposes a similar
//!       feature: by setting the first byte in the socket file path to `NULL`
//!       (`\0`), the socket is placed into a separate namespace instead of
//!       being placed on the filesystem; this is a non-standard extension to
//!       POSIX and is not available on other Unix systems
//! - Windows named pipes have a server and an arbitrary number of clients,
//!   meaning that the separate processes connecting to a named pipe have
//!   separate connections to the server, while Unix FIFO files don't have the
//!   notion of a server or client and thus mix all data written into one sink
//!   from which the data is read by one process
//! - Windows named pipes can be used over the network, while a Unix FIFO file
//!   is still local even if created in a directory which is a mounted network
//!   filesystem
//! - Windows named pipes can maintain datagram boundaries, allowing both sides
//!   of the connection to operate on separate messages rather than on a byte
//!   stream, while FIFO files, like any other type of file, expose only a byte
//!   stream interface
//!
//! If you carefully read through this list, you'd notice how Windows named
//! pipes are similar to Unix domain sockets. For this reason, the
//! implementation of "local sockets" in the `local_socket` module of this crate
//! uses named pipes on Windows and Ud-sockets on Unix.
